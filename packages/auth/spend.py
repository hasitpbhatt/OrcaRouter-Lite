"""Per-key lifetime spend tracking schema and accounting primitives for ``ApiKey.budget_limit_cents``.

This module provides the accounting schema foundation and atomic charge primitives
(part 1 of the 4-part budget subsystem; request-path enforcement is wired in #161).

The cap is a hard lifetime limit on the key's total spend, in microcents
(1 cent = 10_000 microcents; 1 USD = 1_000_000 microcents, matching chat.py's
cost math). `ApiKey.budget_limit_cents` is stored in cents, so every
`cap_microcents` argument below must be that column scaled by MICROCENTS_PER_CENT
(passing raw cents asks whether the key has spent a ten-thousandth of its budget).

Actual cost is only known after the upstream call returns, so accounting is a
single atomic ``UPDATE`` that adds the real cost and refuses to let the counter
exceed the cap::

    UPDATE api_keys SET spent_microcents = spent_microcents + :actual
    WHERE id = :id AND spent_microcents + :actual <= :cap

Concurrent requests for the same key each add their own cost atomically; only a
request whose *own* cost alone would breach the remaining budget matches zero
rows. In that case the counter is clamped to ``cap`` so the key is correctly
maxed out and the next request is rejected — fail-closed, never over-recorded.

This avoids both failure modes of a pre-claim design: it never records spend
past the cap (no over-spend), and it does not reserve the whole remaining budget
up front (so a key's requests are not serialized behind a single in-flight one).

Kept free of FastAPI imports so it stays unit-testable and reusable from
non-HTTP paths (background jobs, CLI minting tools).
